    "## Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing function in this notebook is designed to clean, lemmatize, and vectorize text data, as well as extract and vectorize emojis. Below are the detailed steps involved in the preprocessing pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - The text is converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity.\n",
    "   - Any text within square brackets is removed to eliminate unnecessary content.\n",
    "   - Punctuation marks are stripped from the text.\n",
    "   - Words containing numbers are removed to focus on purely textual data.\n",
    "   - Non-UTF-8 characters, except emojis, are removed.\n",
    "   - Extra whitespace is removed to tidy up the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lemmatization**:\n",
    "   - The cleaned text is lemmatized to reduce words to their base or root form, aiding in better understanding and analysis.\n",
    "   - Common stopwords are removed during this process to focus on meaningful words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Emoji Extraction**:\n",
    "   - Emojis are extracted from the original text using a predefined pattern. This helps in understanding the sentiment and emotion conveyed in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Label Encoding**:\n",
    "   - Sentiment labels are encoded into numerical values using LabelEncoder, facilitating their use in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Text Vectorization**:\n",
    "   - The lemmatized text is vectorized using a pre-trained Word2Vec model. This converts the text into numerical vectors that can be used as input features for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Emoji Vectorization**:\n",
    "   - Emojis are vectorized using a pre-trained Emoji2Vec model, similar to the text vectorization process. This helps in incorporating the semantic meaning of emojis into the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Combining Text and Emoji Embeddings**:\n",
    "   - The text and emoji embeddings are combined to form a comprehensive feature set for the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Data Splitting**:\n",
    "   - The combined feature set is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the preprocessing pipeline, the time taken for each step is measured and printed, providing insights into the efficiency of the process. The final output of the function includes the training and testing sets ready for model training and evaluation.\n"

    "## Sparsity Calculation of Text Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we calculate the sparsity of text vectors in both the training and testing datasets. Sparsity refers to the proportion of zero elements in the vectors, which can give us insights into the density and informativeness of our feature vectors.\n",

    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assumption of Vector Dimensions**:\n",
    "   - We assume that both text vectors and emoji vectors have a dimension of 300.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Separating the Matrices**:\n",
    "   - We separate the combined feature matrix into text vectors for both the training (`X_train`) and testing (`X_test`) datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sparsity Calculation for Training Data**:\n",
    "   - We count the number of zero elements in the text vectors of the training dataset.\n",
    "   - We calculate the total number of elements in the training text vectors.\n",
    "   - Sparsity is computed as the ratio of zero elements to the total number of elements, expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sparsity Calculation for Testing Data**:\n",
    "   - Similarly, we count the number of zero elements in the text vectors of the testing dataset.\n",
    "   - We calculate the total number of elements in the testing text vectors.\n",
    "   - Sparsity is computed as the ratio of zero elements to the total number of elements, expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sparsity of text vectors in the training dataset**: 14.31%\n",
    "- **Sparsity of text vectors in the test dataset**: 15.49%\n",
    "\n",
    "These results indicate that approximately 14.31% of the elements in the training text vectors are zeros, and 15.49% of the elements in the testing text vectors are zeros. This level of sparsity suggests that our text vectors contain a reasonable amount of information, with a significant portion of non-zero elements.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this section, we performed t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to visualize the relationships between the most frequent words and emojis in the dataset. The goal was to identify which words and emojis are closely related in the embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps:\n",
    "1. **Word and Emoji Frequency Extraction**:\n",
    "   - We extracted the most frequent words from the lemmatized text.\n",
    "   - Similarly, we extracted the most frequent emojis from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding Extraction**:\n",
    "   - We used pre-trained Word2Vec and Emoji2Vec models to obtain embeddings for the most frequent words and emojis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **t-SNE Embedding**:\n",
    "   - We combined the embeddings of words and emojis.\n",
    "   - We applied t-SNE to reduce the high-dimensional embeddings to two dimensions for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scatter Plot**:\n",
    "   - We plotted the t-SNE results, where each point represents a word or an emoji.\n",
    "   - The plot helps us see which words and emojis form clusters, indicating semantic similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observations:\n",
    "- Certain clusters are easily identifiable, such as heart emojis clustering with words related to love.\n",
    "- Similarly, birthday-related emojis cluster with the word \"birthday\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization aids in understanding the semantic relationships and grouping tendencies within the text and emoji data.\n"
